# **App Name**: ImageAI Detective

## Core Features:

- Image Upload & Analysis: Allows users to upload an image for immediate AI analysis to determine if the image was AI generated.
- Iframe Embedding: Embeds an AI detection tool from an external source into the webpage.
- Real-time AI Detection Results: Display real-time AI detection results from the tool.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the webpage layout adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, providing optimal viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant cyan (#00FFFF) for the detection status and glow effects.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated blue (#121E2B) to provide a modern, tech-inspired look. This gives sufficient darkness to make other page elements pop without being fatiguing
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to complement the primary color and add a futuristic feel to key elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for bold titles, paired with 'Inter' sans-serif for body text to keep a modern edge.
- Centered layout with rounded corners for the iframe to give a soft, embedded feel. Add neon glow effects around it.
- Smooth transitions and loading animations to enhance the user experience while the AI tool is processing the image.
